# CodeWars Exercises

Welcome to my CodeWars Exercises repository! This is where I document my journey of sharpening my problem-solving skills by solving CodeWars challenges on a regular basis.

## File Naming Convention

Each exercise is stored in a separate file following the naming convention:

- `<Ku_Level>`: Difficulty level denoted in Kyu (Ku) lower number is the higher difficulty.
- `<Exercise_Name>`: Descriptive name of the CodeWars exercise.

## File Structure

Each file contains the following sections:

1. **Problem Definition**: A description of the problem statement.

2. **Parameters**: List of input parameters required for the function.

3. **Returns**: Expected output or return value.

4. **Examples**: Examples illustrating the usage of the function.

5. **Pseudo Code**: High-level plan before the actual code implementation.

6. **Code**: Implementation of the solution.
